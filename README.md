# Relative Estimator

Relative Estimator is a simple application that can help an agile team during the task estimation process.
The application builds a list of referential tasks using Jira (by Atlassian) issues completed in previous sprints.

# Development
See [React App Development](docs/ReactAppDevelopment.md) for basic information about the web app development.

## Dev Containers - recommended
This project has configured Dev Container (https://containers.dev). To start development simple open IDE of your choice and start dev container: 
* Visual Studio Code; https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers
* JetBrains IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/connect-to-devcontainer.html

## Local Machine: 
### Requirements:
* Node.js - to build web application, 
* Python 3.6+ - to start server and generate the referential tasks list

### Browser App installation
0. Go to root project directory and execute:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
0. After the successful installation, execute the build command:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
0. React App has been built.

### Server installation
It's highly recommended to use some Python Environment Manager eg. venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

0. Go to `server` subdirectory
0. Install python requirements:
    ```
       pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-  In the JIRA section put:
    - jira instance host with protocol, 
    - user and password (with access to the tasks)
- In the FILTERS section enter:
    - project_codes - the code names of the projects to search, 
    - max_results - maximum number of tasks in the referential list
    - exclusion_labels - list of labels that exclude the issues from the referential list
    - oldest_results - resolve date of oldest issue, 
    negative value is expected in format -{I}d where {I} is number of days.
- Section OUTPUT leave unchanged

# Start app
0. Generate the referential issue list and call:
    ```
    python3 generate.py
    ```
   for more options call `python3 generate.py -h`
0. Start server:
